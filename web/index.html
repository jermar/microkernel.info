		<div class="intro">
		<p>Microkernels are operating systems that
outsource the traditional operating system functionality to ordinary user
processes while providing them with mechanisms requisite for implementing it.
Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each
having a distinctive set of goals, features and approaches.  Some of the most
often cited reasons for structuring the system as a microkernel is flexibility,
security and fault tolerance. Many microkernels can take on the role of a
hypervisor too. Microkernels and their user environments are most often
implemented in the C or C++ programming languages with a little bit of
assembly, but other implementation languages are possible too.  In fact, each
component of a microkernel-based system can be implemented in a different
programming language.</p>
		<p>Here is a list of active free, open source
microkernel projects. If your project is missing or this page needs fixing, please <a

			<div class="project escape">
				<img src="img/escape.png"/>
				<div class="desc">
					<h2>Escape</h2>
					<p>A UNIX-like microkernel operating system, that runs on x86, x86_64, ECO32 and MMIX. It is implemented from scratch and uses nearly no third-party components. To fit nicely into the UNIX philosophy, Escape uses a virtual file system to provide drivers and services. Both can present themselves as a file system or file to the user.

			<div class="project helenos">
				<img src="img/helenos.svg"/>
				<div class="desc">
					<h2>HelenOS</h2>
					<p>A portable microkernel-based multiserver operating system designed and implemented from scratch. It decomposes key operating system functionality such as file systems, networking, device drivers and graphical user interface into a collection of fine-grained user space components that interact with each other via message passing.

			<div class="project hurd">
				<img src="img/hurd.svg"/>
				<div class="desc">
					<h2>GNU Hurd</h2>
					<p>The GNU project's replacement for the Unix kernel. Notable features include the distributed virtual filesystem that is used as namespace for system services, high degree of application compatibility by shipping the GNU C library, and the goal of being a general purpose operating system. (<a href="http://hurd.gnu.org">hurd.gnu.org</a>)</p>

			<div class="project l4re">
				<img src="img/fiasco.png"/>
				<div class="desc">
					<h2>L4Re</h2>
					<p>Forms the foundation for application development and interaction on the Fiasco.OC microkernel. It consists of basic services such as program loading and memory management. L4Re also provides the environment for applications, including libraries and process local functionality. (<a href="http://l4re.org">l4re.org</a>)</p>

			<div class="project m3">
				<img src="img/m3.svg"/>
				<div class="desc">
					<h2>M³</h2>
					<p>A <u>m</u>icrokernel-based syste<u>m</u> for heterogeneous <u>m</u>anycores, that is developed as a hardware/OS co-design at the TU Dresden. It aims to support arbitrary cores (general purpose cores, DSPs, FPGAs, ASICs, ...) as first-class citizens. This is achieved by abstracting the heterogeneity of the cores via a new hardware component per core, called data transfer unit. (<a href="https://github.com/TUD-OS/M3">github.com/TUD-OS/M3</a>)</p>
